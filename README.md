# React-Portfolio

## Description

This project was to update our portfolio using react as the front end provider. This project gave us a great challenge to use the knowledge from lecture and develop our skills in one of the leading technologies in this industry. I enjoyed
using React and using a different approach such as routing then active tabs to explore the utility of React. I found the routing to be cleaner, but the documentation is a little ambigious in the set up if using HashRouter. I learned why
the industry enjoys React as the trouble shooting, formatting, and development of front end is seamless and clean.

## Features

You can download my current resume at this site, which is currently outdated from my mechanical engineering background. 

## How to Contribute

Feel free to fork a copy of my code and make changes. I plan on developing this portfolio myself to make it more eye catching with transitions and better css formatting.
I used bootstrap to make the formatting easier and quicker to submit the assignment.

## Tests

I use the acceptance criteria for testing my site to ensure full functionality.
